#  Summary of Subroutines
#  ----------------------#  
#        SUBROUTINE FORCE  (called by main)
#  Runs over all atoms and calculates the force.
#  
#        SUBROUTINE RHOSET
#  Evaluates the argument of the many body part of the potential (rho)
#  Basically runs over all atoms and calculates a pair potential PHI 
#  and its derivative DPHI
#  
#        SUBROUTINE KINTEN
#  Evaluates the kinetic energy contribution to the stresses
#  
#        SUBROUTINE PREDIC
#  First part of predictor corrector integrator
#  
#        SUBROUTINE MATPRO(N,A,B,C)
#  Multiply NxN Matrices
#  
#        SUBROUTINE INVERT(A,B)
#  Invert a matrix
#  
#        SUBROUTINE CORREC
#  second  part of predictor corrector integrator
#  
#        SUBROUTINE RUNAVS(N1,N2,ND,IQUEN)
#  Evaluates thermodynamic averages.  May have fallen into disrepair...
#  
#        SUBROUTINE SETVEL
#  Initialises velocities to correct temperature. note, displacements are initialised in GENERAL, and if incompatible the temperature will drift.  There's no easy way to make them compatible!
#  
#        SUBROUTINE SCALEV(NOSE)
#  Rescales the velocitise with a Nose thermostat for constant-T MD
#  
#        SUBROUTINE LINKUP
#  Assigns atoms to link cells, build neighbour lists etc.
#  
#        SUBROUTINE RELINK
#  Re-assigns atoms to link cells, rebuild neighbour lists etc.
#  
#        SUBROUTINE CHECKN
#  Obsolete - finds N nearest neighbours
#  
#        SUBROUTINE BIN
#  Calculates density profile (obsolete)
#  
#        SUBROUTINE RDF(LAST)
#  Generates Radial distribution Function
#  
#  	Subroutine AUTO(IFFT) 
#  
#  	Builds velocity autocorrelation function (IFFT=0) and
#  evaluates phonon spectrum (IFFT=1).  Beware - it involves an array of
#  length the number of timesteps and will crash if there are more than
#  10000.  Calls to this function are commented out.
#  
#        SUBROUTINE PHONDOT(NST)
#  Projects velocities onto a particular phonon eigenvector (obsolete)
#  
#        SUBROUTINE GENERAL
#  Sets up lattice from fort.19
#  
#       SUBROUTINE POTIN
#  Reads in potential parameters and does sanity checks.  Beware of units!
#  
#      SUBROUTINE EMBED(PE)
#  Deals with the Embedding Function.  In older versions of Moldy the 
#  Second-Moment sqrt embedding was hard coded
#  
#      FUNCTIONS VEE, DVEE, PHI, DPHI, EMB, DEMB
#  Evalulates the functions for EAM-type potentials.
#  Would be better to use lookup tables !
#  
#         SUBROUTINE QUENCH
#  Near-independent programme for Conjugate gradients static relaxation
#  
#        SUBROUTINE DERIVS(N,X,F,G)
#  Similar to FORCE - returns forces in appropriate format for VA14AD 
#  
#        SUBROUTINE VA14AD/VA14CD
#  Antedeluvian Conjugate Gradients solver.  Fortran 66 and lots of GOTO
#  
#        SUBROUTINE RSTART,        FUNCTION RAND1()
#  Random number generator.  Used to initialise displacements and velocities - not mission critical!
#  
#        SUBROUTINE READIN
#  Reformatting input and output.  Obsolete.
